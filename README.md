## Get started

## Overview

### The challange
This project was inspired by ["E-commerce product page challenge"](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6).

I got images of the design for both mobile and desktop verions of the page and had to build the web version from scratch using HTML CSS and Javascript. Check out the folder /starter_files to explore the design images and the styles giude I got.

I had also some requirements. Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Dynamically fetched data (from a json file)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- BEM naming methodology
- Flexbox

### Continued development / future features
In the near future my plan is to add the following features:
- Connection to an API backend.
- Possibility to filter articles and view articles based on categories
- Admin log in with ability to add, edit, and delete articles.
- Also there will be bug fixes and minor feature enhachements. Check out the issues section to see all planned features.
